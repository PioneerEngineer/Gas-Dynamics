# GasDynamics
The purpose of this repository is for creating calculators that help engineers solve technical problems for gas dynamics.
In order for the code to work, the script will have to be running in the same folder as the .CSV look-up tables.

This GUI tool will be supported as requests come in. Enjoy!
